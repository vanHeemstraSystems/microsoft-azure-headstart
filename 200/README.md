Set up your initial environment

- Have an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?utm_source=campaign&utm_campaign=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension&mktingSource=vscode-tutorial-app-service-extension).

I have a Pay-as-You-Go subscription with Azure, browse to https://portal.azure.com/?quickstart=True#view/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/QuickstartCenterBlade

To keep a free subscription with Azure see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqx_el2Vs28

- Install [Node.js LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/). Run the command ```node --version``` to verify that Node.js is installed.

- Install [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), with which you run commands in any shell to provision and configure Azure resources.
